The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A modern, minimalist logo depicting a stylized shield with an upward-pointing arrow integrated into its center, symbolizing security and growth. The shield is rendered in a deep navy blue with a subtle gradient, while the arrow is bright emerald green, giving a sense of progress. The background is a soft light gray with a faint geometric texture. The overall design is clean, professional, and conveys trust, monitoring, and analytical insight.
